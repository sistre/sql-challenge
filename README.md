SQL Homework
Sean Istre

The SQL Challenge homework assignment requires the creation of table schema to hold data from the six CSVs for a fictitious comapany Pewlett Hackard holding data about employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s, the import of those CSVs into a SQL database constructed from that schema, and the execution of queries on the imported data.

The files associated with these tasks are located in the EmployeeSQL folder of this repository. Inside this folder are two subfolders: data and sql. The data folder holds all of the CSVs containing the employee data. The sql folder contains an ERD image, the schema file to create the tables to hold all of the data, and a queries file containing all of the required queries in a single file. The queries are as as follows:

1. List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.

2. List first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.

3. List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name.

4. List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

5. List first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."

6. List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

7. List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

8. In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.

AND

Epilogue. Search employee ID number 499942. (Which basically shows that all the data is an elaborate April Foolsday prank)
